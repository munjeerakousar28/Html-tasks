    <summary><b>Paneer</b></summary>
    <p>Paneer is an Indian cheese that's made from curdled milk and some sort of fruit or vegetable acid 
        like lemon juice. There are some distinct traits that make Paneer the cheese that it is:
        <li>It is an unaged cheese</li>
        <li>It's a soft cheese</li>
        <li>It doesn't melt</li>
        You can eat paneer as a snack, incorporate it into your favorite Indian dishes or enjoy over 
        breakfast. And while cheese might not seem like a common breakfast item, don’t 
        knock it until you've tried it.</p>

        <summary><b>Mushroom</b></summary>
        <p>Many people think that mushrooms are vegetables. But this is not the case. 
            All vegetables and fruits come from edible plants. The main characteristic of plants is that they contain chlorophyll, 
            which is used to convert energy from sunlight into carbohydrates. However, mushrooms contain no chlorophyll which 
            means they can not photosynthesize; they 'steal' the carbohydrates they need from plants. A mushroom (Agaricus Bisporus) 
            is one of the many species of fungi. 
            They have been given their own kingdom due to the sheer number of species that exist: 'The Kingdom of Fungi'.</p><br>
